0,How do I get away from devops,"Iv been a DE for around 5 years now. I love working with data, building pipelines, ML platforms, supporting BI/DA/DS teams, etc. But I HATE dev ops.

I work for a company with a pretty complex cloud environment setup. Handling permissions and networking between microservices takes up about 80% of my daily energy.

It seems like a lot of DE jobs require quite a bit of devops work. Is this true?

How do I transition to a role that focuses less on devops and more on software design/performance? Iv been thinking of Skilling up and trying to transition into an ML. Engineer role. Would a role like that theoretically have less devops responsibility?",42,1.0,2023-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16ysjx8/how_do_i_get_away_from_devops/,burns_after_reading
1,"New job. Minor shit show rant, and advice needed.","So like the title says I started a new job today. Figure out why this report written in R broke 2 months ago. I open up a single file with 6952 lines in it. All that's left of me is a 2 page word dock explaining it the main file that call 3 other files, each with 2-3k lines of R code, to create a single 7 page PDF report from a single data source.

WHAT THE ABSOLUTE HELL AM I LOOKING AT LOL. I don't know R, but it's similar enough to python that I can follow along to get the gist of what it's doing. BUT STILL! WHO NEED 10K+ LINES OF CODE FOR THIS?

Should I tell them it's all bunk and make my case to start from scratch, or just buckle down and learn myself some R to make it work?

Edit:
So after further investigation there are 3 major issues.

1: He would comment out old code and leave it in the file. Shout out @Strider_A for the git joke. After deleting all the obvious old code I have taken it down to a total of 5,679 lines of code among 4 files.

1.5: he has multiple SQL queries as strings in file. I could probably just copy paste those to a different file and figure out how R opens and reads files pretty easy.

2: He seems to be allergic to loops or reusable functions. 300 lines of calling the exact same function with the same inputs, but typing out every column name rather than looping through the columns. Or 1000+ lines of the same function copy/pasted with a different name for each column name.

3: assigning variables with hard coded paths to dozens of files rather than walking through the directory.

Bonus round: I don't know enough about R to know if this is bad, but like 400 lines of creating 3 tables. Running a few data validation scripts on each column matching regex. Idk this part is probably fineISH.

I might have overreacted to the 10k+ lines. This probably won't be too difficult to figure out.

2,Is Polaris worth learning over pyspark? Or is it just hype while the industry has no intention of moving away from a Apache/Cloud framework,"I’ve been reading a lot about polaris but one thing about the industry I’ve seen is that new technologies come and have a a lot of hype but do not cause any real change to the current accepted stack.

3,Failing to see impact and progression in DE,"So I’ve been working as a DE for 1.5 years. I’ve touched on some cloud, some ci/cd, lots of ETL and some database design. I enjoy the work but it seems to me that each DE job is sort of like this. Is this it? Do I just make pipelines until I hit senior or manager or am I missing something? Like there’s always work to be done and although we implement interesting solutions, no one really cares instead they ask for delivery dates or why the data is wrong. I’ve seen this across 2 teams, does DE not get recognition? 

Like I enjoy the work day to day but when I look at what I do or am creating, it just doesn’t seem impactful compared to other SWE roles like cloud/security/infra. 

I’m looking to switch jobs and next job will be more analytics focused (tableau/ETL). After working though I don’t know what my progression will be, like what does a senior / engineer manager in data do? How do I get there? Is it fulfilling?

It’s a loaded question I’m mainly just concerned about the culture &amp; future of DE work and if I made the right choice doing this after graduating with a CS degree.

I’m based in Toronto if that helps",14,0.95,2023-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16yhc5t/failing_to_see_impact_and_progression_in_de/,Big-Comparison321
4,Advice on Azure Data Engineering,"Hi,

I've built a data pipeline using an orchestrated azure function that has 5 or so steps (python scripts) that load data from a storage blob, perform a bunch of transformations on the data then load into an azure SQL database. I'm running into problems as I'm hitting the 10minute limit.

On top of this I'd also like to host and schedule a whole bunch of web scrapers (which would also probably hit the 10minute limit)

I'm looking at alternatives whilst staying within the Azure ecosystem. Currently I'm thinking of getting an Azure VM and installing airflow/prefect to run and manage this pipeline. The VM would also host and run the web scrapers.

Are there any other solutions you can recommend or anything I'm missing?",13,0.93,2023-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16yo0lc/advice_on_azure_data_engineering/,lieutenant_lowercase
5,Feeling a bit down regarding my DE career,"I have been working in Data for 5 years, the last 2 as DE. During that time I have worked for same number of companies (around 1 year per company)

The problem for me is that all companies did not really understood what DE is about. Finding this subreddit has been an eye-opener for me also because I am reading all about this cool tools and ideas but I haven't really worked with anything regarding proper DE.

I just recently snatched an opportunity as a Sr DE but to my surprise, the team is more BI that anything else. One person even holds the same title as me but doesn't even know SQL. Plus the company work with external dbs (some systems have their own dbs and we have reader access only). During this time I have only made some queries and helped with some dashboards and that's it. This is almost the same thing that I did on my past company as DE.

I feel that I have a very good SQL, a decent Python and useful knowledge of BI Tools (mostly Tableau and PowerBI) and have a certification on AWS. I also sell myself very good on interviews which I feel has given me a better job opportunity each year. 

I often read about tools like dbt, terraform, airflow etc. I kind of know how they work but the reality is that I have not touched any of that.

I really want to give value and to this point in my carreer I really feel that I need to be updating myself but I don't really know how to that without proper exposure.

6,Is it typical to see Data Engineer and Data Science duties intertwined on Internship roles with smaller companies?,"Hey there, so ive been on the internship hunt for quite a long time now and 2 of the 3 interviews I've managed to get thus far I've wound up getting surprised with a surprising amount of DS questions (stats, ML modeling experience, prior work with DS/ML tools) along with typical SQL + Data Modeling, Python, Data Integration/Orchestration tooling questions.

The thing is this hasn't always been very explicit in the job posting and I've only really taken intro-level coursework in stats and ML (almost entirely intro-level supervised learning concepts and models, lightly touched unsupervised learning at the end) so I'm very weak footed when answering DS questions that go much further beyond basic regression in complexity. Im now wondering if I need to sit down and spend time improving that side of my skillset?

Its also extra stressful because doing an internship is a mandatory part of my undergrad program to graduate and with how brutally slim job postings are on average I cant afford to keep slipping on these interviews",7,0.9,2023-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/16yx85g/is_it_typical_to_see_data_engineer_and_data/,Anic135

8,Centrally documenting data flows of a BI product,"I have been tasked with centrally documenting a BI product and I am wondering how professionals approach this problem as I am relatively new to this field of work.

This product in short boils down to: get data from source system --&gt; select and transform data in SQL --&gt; store created tables in data warehouse --&gt; load in Power BI.

Of course there is a number of standard approaches in place such as commenting the SQL queries etc. but I am trying to find the best way to centrally store all underlying relationships in this data product. Such that for every Power BI measure, I store the used data warehouse column(s) and the source column(s) used to generate said data warehouse column(s).

I attached a visual example of the relationships I am trying to centrally document, quickly written up in MS Excel style. In the example *my\_powerbi\_measure\_1* is created using *my\_datawarehouse\_column1*/*2*/*3* and *my\_datawarehouse\_column1* is created using *my\_sourcedata\_column1*.

12,Lambda to Firehose vs directly to S3,"I'm pulling data from a realtime feed at the moment, about 200k records and then pushing them to a Kinesis Data Firehose.  I've experimented with batch sizes and the like, but at the moment I'm seeing that the 200k records when serialised is about 20MB, and the batch and write to disk as parquet via KDF is taking a couple of minutes.  


The realtime feed is updated every 15 seconds, but I'm so far unable to ingest at that rate, so I've dialled it back to every 2 minutes for the time being.

Currently the task is billed for Lambda, KDF and S3.

I've been experimenting and using Polars to make the 200k records into a dataframe and then writing it directly to S3. It takes about 15 seconds and the parquet file is about 700kb. It's light years faster and cheaper than KDF and I can run it at a faster rate than the KDF.

The overhead is Lambda and S3.  


Now I understand that if you can't afford to drop/loose any of the data, then you need to have a data stream manager of some flavour, but why is it so much slower and so much more expensive?

21,having a hard time self-studying kafka,"Hi all, I currently know how to do basic batch-processing ETL (have tried extracting data from APIs and gsheets using python, used GCS / AWS S3 buckets to store raw and transformed data if needed, and ingest to bigquery (I find that redshift is too expensive for personal projects so I just stick to bigquery), using airflow for orchestration, docker compose to setup airflow, all inside a headless VM, port passthrough so I can access airflow web UI in my browser).

Now i want to learn streaming ETL using kafka and pyspark. I find it difficult to setup a self-managed kafka cluster as you have to learn so many new things at once, at the same time I don't think it's gonna be cheap to rely on GCP / AWS for kafka (this is my understanding, please correct me if I'm wrong). There's not much ""updated"" guides on the internet when I tried to search. For example I learned that the newer versions of kafka can avoid using zookeeper (and some users find zookeeper a pain in the ass so that's good, right?) but there's basically zero guides to setting up kafka without using zookeeper. Yes, there's the official docs and I tried it but it only teaches the super basic setup (no connections to anything).
